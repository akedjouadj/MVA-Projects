This project was as part of the course [Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://www.master-mva.com/cours/probabilistic-graphical-models/).

We review the paper: [scVAE, Variational auto-encoders for single-cell gene expression data](https://pubmed.ncbi nlm.nih.gov/32415966/).

We implemented a Variational AutoEncoder and a Gaussian Mixture Variational AutoEncoder from scratch using Pytorch; we tested our implementation on synthetic data and on large real single cells gene expression data.
