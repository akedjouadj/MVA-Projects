On this repo, you cand find some of the projects I worked on during the master's degree on mathematics, computer vision and machine learning (MVA), 2023-2024.

1. Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks.
2. Sketch images classification: a kaggle format data challenge.
3. Variational AutoEncoder for sinlge cells gene expression data.
4. Image Logit Lens, a new approach for vision transformers interpretability: see https://medium.com/@adjileyeb/unlocking-visual-insights-applying-the-logit-lens-to-image-data-with-vision-transformers-b99cb70dd704
